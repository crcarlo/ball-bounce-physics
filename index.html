      <h1>Ray bounce physics</h1>
      <p>
        In this article I am discussing a possible aproach on how to implement a
        collision detection and bounce beaviour of a 2D circular moving object
        on other static objects.<br /><br />
        In this article you will find interactive examples.
      </p>
      <h2>The problem</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine you are writing a simulation or a game that involves some kind
        of ball physics, like Pinball or Pachinko. <br />
        <br />
        I'm assuming that the simulation involves a cycle of update of the ball
        position depending on the velocity and position of the previous state.
        <br />
        <br />
        So you have a ball object that on a certain moment t_n is located in A
        and on t_n+1 is on B. <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <div class="interactive-example" id="movingBall"></div>
      <span> Fig. 1 </span>
      <p>
        What may happen is that at a certain point the next state of the ball is
        invalid because of a collision with another object (like a peg for
        example). <br />
        <br />
        In this case we will consider a collision with a static ball (I.E. that
        won't move) centered in C.
      </p>
      <div class="interactive-example" id="circleLineIntersection"></div>
      <span> Fig. 2 </span>
      <p>
        At this point we might want to find a new valid state for our moving
        ball by detecting the collision and following a bounce behaviour.
        <br />
        <br />
        This means we want to find a new valid state for our ball. How?
