      <h1>Ball bounce physics</h1>
      <p>
        In this article I am discussing a possible aproach on how to implement a
        collision detection and bounce beaviour of a 2D circular moving object
        on other static objects.<br /><br />
        You will also find interactive examples and a link to the source code.

      <h2>The problem</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine you are writing a simulation or a game that involves some kind
        of ball physics, like Pinball or Pachinko. <br />
        <br />
        I'm assuming that the simulation involves a cycle of update of the ball
        position depending on velocity and position of the previous state (like
        a
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration#Algorithmic_representation"
          target="blank"
          >Verlet integration</a
        >).
        <br />
        <br />
        So you have a ball object that on a certain moment t_n is located in A
        and on t_(n+1) is in B. <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <div class="interactive-example" id="movingBall"></div>
      <span> Fig. 2 </span>
      <p>
        What may happen is that at a certain point the next state of the ball is
        going to collide with another object (like a peg for example). <br />
        <br />
        In this case we will consider a collision with a static ball (i.e. that
        won't move) centered in C.
      </p>
      <div class="interactive-example" id="circleLineIntersection"></div>
      <span> Fig. 3 </span>
      <p>
        At this point we might want to find a new not colliding state for our
        moving ball by detecting the collision and calculating a bounce
        behaviour.
        <br />
        <br />
        This means we want to find the new position for the ball and new
        direction away from the object that caused the collision. <br /><br />
        So how do we do it?
      </p>
      <div class="interactive-example" id="theProblem"></div>
      <span> Fig. 4 </span>
      <h2>The simplified problem</h2>
      <p>
        First of all. How do we find out if the next state is colliding? <br />
        <br />
        That's pretty simple. We can just see of the distance between the center
        of our ball in the next state is colliding with the static object.
        <br />
        <br />
        If the distance is less than the sum of the radii then it's colliding,
        otherwise it is not.
      </p>
      <div class="interactive-example" id="collisionDetection"></div>
      <span> Fig. 5 </span>
      <p>
        Now that we have discovered a collision how do we implement a bounce
        effect? <br />
        <br />
        That might sound complicated having two circular objects. You may say
        that the moving ball should stop at the point it touches the other ball,
        then bounce back. But how do we find where it should stop? Let's try a
        simpler aproach. <br />
        <br />
        We might notice that the collision detection is the same that we would
        obtain by calculating the moving effect of a single point colliding with
        a ball of radius equal to the sum of the radii of the two balls.
      </p>
      <div class="interactive-example" id="collisionDetectionSingleBall"></div>
      <span> Fig. 6 </span>
      <p class="note">
        <b>NOTE</b> <br />
        By using this collision detection algorythm we will not detect a
        collision in case the line segment AB (trajectory of our ball)
        intersects the the colliding object and B is not in a colliding
        position. We are just going to ignore this case, but you might use a
        different aproach if you want to avoid this problem by calculating the
        interseciton point between the segment and the ball (that might be more
        demanding in terms of total computations).
      </p>
      <p>
        Likely the point of collision is where the segment AB intersects the
        ball cenetered in C with radius equal to the sum of the radii.
      </p>
      <div class="interactive-example" id="pointOfIntersection"></div>
      <h2>Concolusion</h2>
      <p>
        At this point we just need to calculate the reflection of the segment
        P1B on the tangent line of the ball on P1. <br /><br />
        That means that we need to find the symmetric point of B on the tangent
        line.
      </p>
      <div class="interactive-example" id="pointOfCollision"></div>
      <span> Fig. 7 </span>
      <p>
        And so we found B1. <br />
        <br />
        We can also calculate the new direction for the ball. That is B1 - P1.
